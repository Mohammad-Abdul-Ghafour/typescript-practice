# Typescript Practice

**`TypeScript`** is a programming language that can be use as alternative to **`JavaScript`** so we can say it is a **`flavor`** of **`JavaScript`**.

And Actually known as **`superset`** of JavaScript meaning that it's basically extends the language with new features and syntax.

## TypeScript Features

* **`Strict Types`** : That allow us to use Strict variables Types ( e.g if we declared a variable with type number we can't change that variable type to another data type ).

* **`Modern Features`** : TS supports modern features like arrow functions, let, const, ... etc and because TS is compiled into JS it allow us to use those features even if they doesn't fully supported in browsers.

* **`Extra Features`** : Like generics, interfaces, tuples ... etc.

## Installing TypeScript Globally

To install TS we need Node.js installed on our device then we can install TS using Node Package Manager (npm).

> npm install -g typescript

## Working With TS

TS is the same as JS so we create new file with extension of *`.ts`* instead of *`.js`* and after we write our code as we said before we have to compile TS into JS because browser does not understands TS, and that is very simple, open your terminal inside the project directory and just run the following command.

> tsc the-file-name.ts the-file-name.js

**`tsc`** : It's a command to compile TS

**`the-file-name.ts`** : It's the name of your TS file you want to compile into JS

**`the-file-name.js`** : It's the name of the JS file you want to put your translated TS in.

We can just simply type the name of the TS file and it will automatically create for us JS file with the same TS file name if the file does not exist.

> tsc the-file-name.ts

Here every time we want to write TS or edit we gonna rerun the **`tsc`** command, but we can make it automatically recompile just by adding *`-w`* to the command to tell TS to watch over this file every time we made a change and save it's gonna recompile that automatically.

> tsc the-file-name.ts -w

## NOTES

* Browsers by default do not understands TS so we have to compile it to JS ( most cases it's very easy to compile it down to JS and it comes with a load of extra features ).

* TypeScript forces us to write cleaner and better code with less error grown.

* TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values, itâ€™s a static type checker.

* After we compiled the TS file if we opened the TS and JS file at the same time it might gave you an error line in the TS file, don't worry that maybe because of a conflict between the tow file but if you closed the JS file the errors should be gone.
