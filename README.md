# Typescript Practice

**`TypeScript`** is a programming language that can be use as alternative to **`JavaScript`** so we can say it is a **`flavor`** of **`JavaScript`**.

And Actually known as **`superset`** of JavaScript meaning that it's basically extends the language with new features and syntax.

## TypeScript Features

* **`Strict Types`** : That allow us to use Strict variables Types ( e.g if we declared a variable with type number we can't change that variable type to another data type ).

* **`Modern Features`** : TS supports modern features like arrow functions, let, const, ... etc and because TS is compiled into JS it allow us to use those features even if they doesn't fully supported in browsers.

* **`Extra Features`** : Like generics, interfaces, tuples ... etc.

## Installing TypeScript Globally

To install TS we need Node.js installed on our device then we can install TS using Node Package Manager (npm).

> npm install -g typescript

## NOTES

* Browsers by default do not understands TS so we have to compile it to JS ( most cases it's very easy to compile it down to JS and it comes with a load of extra features ).

* TypeScript forces us to write cleaner and better code with less error grown.

* TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values, itâ€™s a static type checker.
